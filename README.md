We have taken base code from the YouTuber Shaun Halverson to create a keylogger program that uses the pynput library and keyboard module to monitor a user's input.
Additionally, we have modified the code that fixes the error of pressing special keys (ex: the space bar).
  *Note the modified code considers the keys pressed on a Mac computer--> Unsure of how this code runs on a Windows computer

We have also provided a keylogger program that ChatGPT has written.
This keylogger works differently, where the 'esc' button ends the program
